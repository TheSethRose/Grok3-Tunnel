# Grok3 Tunnel

A self-hosted API tunnel that provides access to Grok3 through a simple REST interface.

## Features

- Simple REST API for interacting with Grok3
- Support for streaming and non-streaming responses
- Special prefixes (@search, @reason) to enable DeepSearch and Thinking modes
- Flexible authentication via cookie string
- Support for image generation and file attachments
- Comprehensive web search capabilities
- Step-by-step reasoning mode

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI
- Requests
- Valid Grok3 cookie values (requires a valid Grok account)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Get your Grok cookie string (see Authentication section)

## Authentication

To use the API, you need your Grok cookie string which will serve as your API key in most client applications. Here's how to get it:

1. Go to [Grok.com](https://grok.com)
2. Log in to your account (Grok account required)
3. Open your browser's developer tools (F12)
4. Go to the Network tab
5. Make a request in the Grok UI
6. Find a request to `grok.com`
7. Right-click on the request, select "Copy as cURL"
8. From that cURL command, extract the cookie string

Minimum cookie requirements: `sso` and `sso-rw`

> **Important**: In most API clients (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), you should paste your cookie string directly into the API Key field. The cookie string IS your API key.

You can also provide the cookie string in your requests in one of two ways:

1. **Authorization Header (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   Authorization: Bearer your_cookie_string_here
   ```

2. **Request Body**
   ```json
   {
     "cookie_string": "your_cookie_string_here"
   }
   ```

### Client Setup Example

When setting up in clients like ChatGPT or Claude:
1. Provider name: `Grok3`
2. API Base URL: `http://localhost:11435/api`
3. API Key: `your_cookie_string_here` (ex. sso-rw=eyJhbGc...)

## Usage

1. Start the server: `python server.py`
2. The server will be available at `http://localhost:11435/api`

### Special Prefixes for Advanced Features

This API supports special message prefixes that enable Grok's advanced features without needing to modify the API request structure. This is especially useful when using third-party tools that don't allow customizing the request payload.

Simply add ONE of these prefixes to the beginning of your message:

1. **@search** - Enables DeepSearch mode (comprehensive web search)
   ```
   @search What are the latest developments in quantum computing?
   ```
   This automatically configures:
   - Sets `deepsearchPreset` to "comprehensive"
   - Enables web search tools
   - Sets `disableSearch` to false

2. **@reason** - Enables Thinking/Reasoning mode (step-by-step reasoning)
   ```
   @reason How would you solve this equation: 3x + 5 = 17?
   ```
   This automatically configures:
   - Sets `isReasoning` to true
   - Adds custom instructions for step-by-step reasoning

> **Important**: Use only one prefix at a time (@search OR @reason), not both together. This matches how the official Grok interface works, which only allows using either DeepSearch or Thinking mode in a single query, not both simultaneously.

The prefix will be automatically detected, the corresponding feature will be enabled, and the prefix will be stripped from your message before being sent to Grok.

### API Endpoints

#### Chat Completions Endpoint

The main endpoint for chat interactions:

```python
import requests
import json

# Using the @search prefix to enable DeepSearch
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:11435/api/chat/completions",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer your_cookie_string_here"
    },
    json={
        "model": "grok-3",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "@search What is the latest research on fusion energy?"}]
    }
)

print(response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

For streaming:

```python
import requests
import json

# Using the @reason prefix to enable Thinking mode
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:11435/api/chat/completions",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer your_cookie_string_here"
    },
    json={
        "model": "grok-3",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "@reason Explain how quantum computers work"}],
        "stream": True
    },
    stream=True
)

for line in response.iter_lines():
    if line:
        line_str = line.decode('utf-8')
        if line_str.startswith("data: "):
            data = json.loads(line_str[6:])
            if "choices" in data and data["choices"]:
                if "delta" in data["choices"][0]:
                    content = data["choices"][0]["delta"].get("content", "")
                    if content:
                        print(content, end="")
```

#### Generate Endpoint

For simpler use cases, you can use the `/api/generate` endpoint:

```python
import requests
import json

# Using the @search prefix
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:11435/api/generate",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer your_cookie_string_here"
    },
    json={
        "model": "grok-3",
        "prompt": "@search What are the latest advancements in renewable energy?",
        "stream": False
    }
)

print(response.json()["response"])
```

Using curl:

```bash
# Streaming request with @search prefix
curl http://localhost:11435/api/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_cookie_string_here" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-3",
    "prompt": "@search Why is the sky blue?"
  }'

# Non-streaming request with @reason prefix
curl http://localhost:11435/api/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_cookie_string_here" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-3",
    "prompt": "@reason Why is the sky blue?",
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Advanced Configuration

Took guts and caffeine to crank this out. Now, I'm asking YOU to back me. $5 a month. That's it.
Pocket change to keep me fueled and slamming out more projects like this.

Think about it â€” what's $5? A shitty coffee? Or a ticket to more tools that actually DO something?
I'm not here to beg; I'm here to BUILD. Support me, and I'll keep the good stuff coming. No fluff.

Sponsor me. Let's make more noise together. ðŸš€ (written by Grok3)
